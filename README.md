## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
My screenshot was taken on off hours so the colors red and green colors aren't visible.  I tested it earlier in the day when the colors were visible but forgot to screenshot it.
